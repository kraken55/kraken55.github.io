Raise your hands if you know how to count.

Good.

I don't particularly like going out (🙄), but I think I have got to known enough people throughout the course of my life to realize something. It doesn't really matter whether they were dirt poor or filthy rich, a PhD superstar or a humble labourer, I do not think I have ever met a single soul who couldn't recall the names of numbers from zero to ten, even if they could barely write their own name.

Indeed, the notion of numbers and quantities is so natural that even little kids have some intuitive (but often pretty wrong😛) understanding of it. I think this further reinforces the hypothesis or, according to some researchers, the fact that working with numbers came *way* before written language.

Take a look at this thing for example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishango_bone

This is a 20,000 year old bone with tally marks on it, used to record some numerical information (at least, according to some scholars). To put this into perspective, the earliest form of the Mesopotamian cuneiform writing emerged at around 2900 BCE. 

Of course, as technology improved people started to move away from tally marks and actually took the time to develop numbers system. One of the longest lived, and unfortunately also one of the most insufferable one, was the Roman number system. You know, I, II, III, IV, etc. People hate it and have no idea how to parse them. I think this image tells you all you have to know.

Thankfully, this number system has been replaced by Hindu-Arabic numerals, which make a *lot more* sense (to me at least😛). These are the familiar symbols that we love and use everyday:
\\[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, \dots\\]
Obviously, there is no largest number so I just put an ellipsis at the to indicate that I could technically count forwards indefinitely if I wanted to 😛.

I hope your first-grade teacher did a good job explaining them, because I don't feel like doing that here 😇. Let's be real, if you could turn on your computer and visit this site by yourself, you know what these are.

The numbers are often displayed on a line, like this:

Since there is an infinite amount of numbers but only a finite amount of screen, there is customarily an arrow on the right to indicate that it should technically be extended into infinity (🤩) in that direction.
