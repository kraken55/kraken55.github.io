Raise your hands if you know how to count.

Good.

I don't particularly like going out (🙄), and as a consequence I know few people, but I have
yet to meet one who couldn't recall the names of numbers from zero to ten.

Indeed, the notion of numbers and quantities is so natural that even little kids have some intuitive understanding of it. I think this further reinforces the hypothesis or, according to some researchers, the fact that working with numbers came *way* before written language.

Take a look at this thing for example: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishango_bone]()

This is a 20,000 year old bone with tally marks on it, widely thought to have been used to record some numerical information. To put this into perspective, the earliest form of the Mesopotamian cuneiform writing emerged at around 2900 BCE. 

Of course, as technology improved people started to move away from tally marks and actually took the time to develop number systems. One of the longest lived, and unfortunately also one of the most insufferable ones, was the Roman number system. You know, I, II, III, IV, etc. Even though they have been around for thousands of years, people still
have no idea how to parse them. I think this image tells you all you have to know.

Thankfully, this number system has been replaced by Hindu-Arabic numerals, which make a *lot more* sense. These are the familiar symbols that we love and use everyday:
\\[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, \dots\\]
Obviously, there is no largest number so I just put an ellipsis at the end to indicate that I could technically count forwards indefinitely if I wanted to.

It seems only natural to start a mathematical journey at the beginning of mathematics.
Now, I'm not going to pretend to be your first grade teacher and explain how to count on your fingers
or teach you how to add using apples, but starting with arithmetic is going to help me
introduce you to a couple of big ideas from higher mathematics (and also revise high school math in the
process 😜).

All in all, I hope your first-grade teacher did a good job explaining counting to you, because I don't feel like doing that here 😇. Let's be real, if you could turn on your computer and visit this site by yourself, you know what numbers are.

The numbers are also often displayed on a line, like this:

Since there is an infinite amount of numbers but only a finite amount of screen, there is customarily an arrow on the right to indicate that it should technically be extended into infinity in that direction.
