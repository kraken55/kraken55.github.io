Turns out that in real life, having to add the same number many times comes up quite often.
Let's say I have eight PCs, each equipped with 16 GBs of RAM. How much RAM do I have in total
(always too little 😢)?
Well, to find out I have to repeatedly add 16 eight times in a row. That is, I need to compute 8 *times* 16.
Multiplication.

This is also kiddie math. You already know that multiplication is a shorthand for repeated addition.
That is
\\[16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 8 \cdot 16\\]

The answer is 128, of course:
\\[8 \cdot 16 = 128\\]

## The order of terms

What happens in the case where I have 16 PCs with 8 GBs of RAM each?
To count the total amount of RAM I have now, I have to compute 16 times 8, which is also 128.
In writing, this is
\\[16 \cdot 8 = 128\\]

Similar to addition, swapping the two terms when doing multiplication doesn't change the result.
Here are some more examples:
\\[3 \cdot 5 = 5 \cdot 3\\]
\\[11 \cdot 10 = 10 \cdot 11\\]
\\[3459 \cdot 21356 = 21356 \cdot 3459\\]

You see now that this property holds for addition and multiplication too. It's special. So special in fact,
that it has a name. **Commutativity**. We say that **addition and multiplication are commutative operations**.
You will get to know other commutative operators in mathematics.

Writing this property down with letters is very similar to the addition case:
\\[a \cdot b = b \cdot a\\]

When using letters with multiplication, it is customary to drop the dot between the terms. Like this:
\\[ab = ba\\]
Whenever you see two letters next to each other, it should be interpreted as multiplication.

When $$a = 2$$ and $$b = 7$$, we can substitute into this template to get the statement
\\[2 \cdot 7 = 7 \cdot 2\\]
This is totally the same think as with addition.

I want to make one thing clear. **You can substitue arbitrarily complex mathematical expression into
the templates of general properties like the one above**. I've been doing it with single numbers for simplicity,
but there's nothing stopping you from going crazy with it.

Recall the commutative property of addition: $$a + b = b + a$$.
Suppose that $$a = 11 \cdot (3 + 5)$$ and $$b = 2 + 8$$.
Substituting in, I get
\\[(11 \cdot (3 + 5)) + (2 + 8) = (2 + 8) + (11 \cdot (3 + 5))\\]

When plugging in entire expression into these sort of templates, always use parentheses like I did above.
It's much easier to see the expressions standing in place of the letter $$a$$ and $$b$$.
Of course, after you've plugged the values in there's nothing stopping you from deleting and adding in parentheses,
so long as the rules of mathematics allow it 😉.

## Parentheses

What about the parentheses property? Well, let's investigate!

Take the following multiplication problem:
\\[3 \cdot (10 \cdot 6)\\]

As with addition, we evaluate the parentheses first, and then the rest.
\\[3 \cdot (10 \cdot 6) = 3 \cdot 60 = 180\\]
I first replaced the parentheses with it's value, 60, and then performed the remaining multiplication.

Let's now move the parentheses one position to the left. This gives us
\\[(3 \cdot 10) \cdot 6\\]
Evaluating this can be done as follows:
\\[(3 \cdot 10) \cdot 6 = 30 \cdot 6 = 180\\]

This confirms our suspicion that the parentheses property holds for multiplication as well.
Here are some more examples to convince yourself:
\\[25 \cdot (4 \cdot 6) = (25 \cdot 4) \cdot 6\\]
\\[3 \cdot (4 \cdot 100) = (3 \cdot 4) \cdot 100\\]

This property also holds for addition, as we've seen. This one is also pretty special, and it also has a name.
**Associativity**. **Addition and multiplication are associative operations**.

With letters, I can write this as
\\[a(bc) = (ab)c\\]

To create a concrete equation from this template, let's assume that $$a = 7$$,
$$b = 11 + 2$$ and $$c = 49$$.
Plugging these in, we obtain
\\[7 \cdot ((11 + 2) \cdot 49) = (7 \cdot (11 + 2)) \cdot 49\\]

## Multiplication in any order

Just like addition, multiplication can be performed in any order with any number of terms.
For example, these are all equal
\\[2 \cdot (125 \cdot 51 \cdot (11 \cdot 3) \cdot 46) \cdot 5\\]
\\[125 \cdot 46 \cdot 5 \cdot (2 \cdot 11 \cdot 3) \cdot 51\\]
\\[5 \cdot 46 \cdot 3 \cdot (11 \cdot 55) \cdot (125 \cdot 2)\\]

You can change the order of terms, delete or add in parentheses, it doesn't matter. It's all the same.
You can use commutativity and associativiy to reason through why this is a correct thing to do,
but let's not waste our time with that.

## Multiplication by 1

Zero is a special number, since it doesn't really have a "value" with respect to addition.
It doesn't contribute to the total. I stated this general property as
\\[a + 0 = a\\]
Of course, since addition is commutative, I could have also said
\\[0 + a = a\\]
since the order doesn't matter 😉. We know that addition is commutative, so we can write it either way.

Is there a number with a similar property for multiplication? One that doesn't change the value of the multiplicand?
Yeah, there is one. And it's *one*.
Look:
\\[1 \cdot 472 = 472\\]
One times 472 is obviously still 472. And it's not hard to imagine that this works for any number.

Using letters to state this general property, I can say
\\[1 \cdot a = a\\]
Since multiplication is commutative, I could also write this as
\\[a \cdot 1 = a\\]

This phenomenon also has a name.
**Zero is the identity element of addition and one is the identity element of multiplication**.

## Multiplication by 0

What should happen when I multiply some number with zero?
For instance
\\[0 \cdot 2 = ?\\]

Let's examine the multiplication table of 2 for a clue!
\\[
    \begin{align}
    6 \cdot 2 &= 12 \newline
    5 \cdot 2 &= 10 \newline
    4 \cdot 2 &= 8 \newline
    3 \cdot 2 &= 6 \newline
    2 \cdot 2 &= 4 \newline
    1 \cdot 2 &= 2 \newline 
    0 \cdot 2 &= ? \newline
    \end{align}
\\]

You can see that as we multiply 2 by smaller and smaller numbers, the result decreases. Specifically,
the result decreases by 2 at each step. This makes sense, since multiplication is technically repeated addition and
at each step, the number of twos we add together decreases by one, so the total decreases by two.

The last step is multiplication by zero. Continuing the pattern, the only thing that makes sense is to
say that the last multiplication is equal to zero.
That is
\\[0 \cdot 2 = 0\\]

This line of reasoning works with any number (try it!). This is another general property, that should be stated using letters
\\[0 \cdot a = 0\\]

Due to commutativity, it's also true that
\\[a \cdot 0 = 0\\]
since reversing the order of multiplication doesn't change the result.

Remember that I can plug in any number in place of $$a$$, even 0 itself. This means that
\\[0 \cdot 0 = 0\\]
which is not that surprising I guess 🤔.

This property also has a formal name.
**Zero is the annihilating element of multiplication.**
Yeah, that's the official name 😼.

# Takeaway

General properties are often so general, that they are true for multiple different types of objects.
A large part of mathematics is generalization. If we know that commutativity is true for addition,
why don't we examine how it behaves with other operations? If zero is the identity element for addition, why don't
we try to find an identity element for multiplication as well? Is there a property that multiplication has
but addition doesn't?

Seeing where a property holds and where it breaks down in different contexts allows us to describe
the property in the most general sense, which is useful and efficient.
